      ðŸŸ£ It is expected by adding parentheses <app-code [code]="'@Input'" /> and
      this will mark this property as settable from outside.
    </p>
    <p>ðŸŸ£ <span class="mark">(!)</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <app-code class="error" [code]="'@Input()smg:string'" /> TypeScript says
        there is no value being set at any point in this component instead, it's
        an uninitialized property
      </li>
      <li>
        <app-code [code]="'@Input()smg!:string'" /> Exclamation mark
        <span class="mark">(!)</span> another TypeScript feature, which tells
        TypeScript that we know that this will definitely be set to some value.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ðŸŸ£ Angular allaws us to configuer those input values we can pass
      aconfiguration object to this, one of this configration is
      <span class="mark">required</span> which telling Angular that this prperty
      must be set
      <app-code [code]="'@Input({required:true})smg!:string'" />
      And telling TypeScript that there definitly will be a value
